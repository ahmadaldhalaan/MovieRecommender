# Movie Recommender

We develop and analyze movie recommender systems in this work and present a Shiny recommender application. The dataset is the 1M dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). We analyze two recommender systems: one based on genre recommendations and one based on user ratings. Our models perform well and produce valuable recommendations. The included report investigates the models and comments on results. The final recommender system can be accessed here:
